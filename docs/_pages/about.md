# About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hello and welcome!  
Iâ€™m Sakhineti Praveena, and this blog documents my journey through Google Summer of Code 2025 with JdeRobot. This summer, Iâ€™ll be contributing to [DetectionMetrics](https://github.com/JdeRobot/DetectionMetrics/tree/master), an open-source toolkit for evaluating perception models across frameworks and datasets. My focus will be on extending its  functionality to detection models, building a more intuitive graphical interface, and establishing a robust CI workflow to streamline development.

With the guidance of my mentors â€” David Pascual HernÃ¡ndez, Sergio Paniego and Santiago Montiel MarÃ­n â€” Iâ€™m excited to take on technical challenges, explore new tools, and grow as an open-source contributor.

Each week, Iâ€™ll be sharing updates, experiences and reflections right here. Whether you're curious about the project or just want a peek into my GSoC journey â€” youâ€™re in the right place.

Thank you for your interest and feel free to reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sakhinetipraveena/) if youâ€™d like to connect. Hereâ€™s to a productive rewarding summer of code!
