## Meeting with Mentors

This week, we discussed the implementation plan in more detail. David suggested that I start with refactoring the `dataset.py` module as a solid entry point into the codebase. Once that is complete, I can gradually move on to refactoring the model class and metrics module. 

They also encouraged me to open a draft PR early so that my progress can be continuously reviewed and improved. David also mentioned an exciting use case for our tool: it will be used to evaluate a trash detection model, making the detection metrics we build directly impactful.

## Progress

I started this week by refactoring the dataset classes. I followed the structure David and I had discussed during the application stage.

The older class structure looked like this: 

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="{{ '/assets/img/blog/2025-06-09-Week-1/oldclassstructure.png' | relative_url }}" 
       alt="Old Class Structure" 
       style="width: 50%; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);" />
</div>

To support detection models more effectively, I’ve reorganized the class hierarchy:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="{{ '/assets/img/blog/2025-06-09-Week-1/newclassstructure.png' | relative_url }}" 
       alt="Old Class Structure" 
       style="width: 50%; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);" />
</div>

I began by identifying the common functionalities shared between segmentation and detection tasks. These were moved into a new base class, `PerceptionDataset`. In this class, I’ve implemented methods like: `__init__` , `__len__` , `make_fname_global` and `append` (assuming the ontology structure is the same as segmentation for now)

If there is some extra info per class in the datasets, the logic in `append` can be overridden later in the `DetectionDataset` class.

Next, I defined the functions specific to segmentation and detection within their respective subclasses. I also incorporated some of the model refactoring work I had prepared during the application phase and finished up the changes.

I’ve raised a [**draft PR**](https://github.com/JdeRobot/DetectionMetrics/pull/312) that includes all these changes. Following David’s suggestion, I split the monolithic class into multiple files to improve modularity and maintainability.

       alt="Old Class Structure" 
       style="width: 50%; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);" />
</div>

## Going ahead

I plan to thoroughly test all the changes I have made. If everything is alright I am thinking defining coco.py and pascalvoc.py could be a potential next step. I also didn’t get much time to explore streamlit this week, hoping to do that as well this coming week.
