## Meeting with Mentors

In this week’s meeting, I began by sharing an update on my current progress. The mentors gave positive feedback and helped clarify the utility functions used in `torch.py` for segmentation. David recommended moving some of these utilities to a shared `torch_utils.py`, as they are commonly used across both modules.

We also discussed the next set of deliverables and finalized this week's goals. Sergio raised a thoughtful question about our choice of **Streamlit** for the UI. He suggested exploring **Gradio** too as an alternative, especially since it is part of hugging face we would have better support. Based on this, I decided to compare both frameworks and evaluate which suits our needs better.

## To-Do for the Week

- [x] Finish support for Torch image detection models  
- [x] Add metrics for detection model evaluation  
- [ ] Create an example notebook for detection metrics evaluation using COCO and Torch models  
- [x] Compare Streamlit and Gradio for building the user interface

## Progress

- I began by finishing the `TorchImageDetectionModel` class where I implemented the `inference()`, `eval()`, and `computation_cost()` methods for Torch-based object detection models.

- For detection metrics, I chose to define a new class, instead of extending the existing `MetricsFactory` meant for segmentation. I added a `DetectionMetricsFactory` in `detection_metrics.py`.  
  It computes per-class metrics (AP, Precision, Recall, TP, FP and FN) and returns them in a pandas DataFrame. As the last row I have also included mAP in the data frame before returning it. It should look like so : 

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/blog/2025-06-23-Week-3/dataframe.png' | relative_url }}" 
   alt="Old Class Structure" 
   style="width: 95%; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);" />
</div>

- I started creating a sample notebook to test my changes using COCO and a Torch model. Since this is the first time I am running my new changes end-to-end, I was facing minor errors. I started debugging each one and made the necessary changes to the classes. I am currently stuck with an error with respect to the indices mismatching between coco and torch. I will take the mentors help with this in the meeting today.

- Simultaneously, I began comparing **Gradio** and **Streamlit** to help decide which framework to use for our UI. I have listed down the pros and cons for each below.

      Gradio
        Pros
        -  Built-in Hosting & Sharing (Gradio Hub, HF Spaces)  
        -  Easy Jupyter Notebook Integration  
        -  Seamless Hugging Face, PyTorch, TensorFlow, sklearn integration  
        -  Clean UI for Inputs/Outputs  
        -  Embeddable in websites via `iframe`

        Cons
        -  Limited Layout Customization  
        -  Multi-page support is basic  
        -  No Built-in Session State  
        -  Not suitable for dashboards or long-running processes  
        -  Limited styling/theming support  

      Streamlit
        Pros
        -  Ideal for Dashboards, Visualizations, Analytics  
        -  Native Multi-page App Support  
        -  Advanced Layouts (columns, tabs, sidebars)  
        -  Built-in Session State  
        -  Broad widget & charting support (Altair, Plotly, etc.)  
        -  Better for scalable, real-time apps  

        Cons
        -  Slightly higher learning curve  
        -  No one-click public sharing from notebooks  
        -  Not embeddable in Jupyter  
        -  No native model integration (manual setup needed)

### What's Next?

For the upcoming week, I’ll work on testing my code changes end-to-end. Fix any errors I face along the way. I will aim to finish the example notebook I started working on. And based on the suggestion from the mentors regarding which UI framework to use, I’ll also start prototyping the user interface.
